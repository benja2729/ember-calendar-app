The University events calendar for Valparaiso University provides a consolidated
list of upcoming events sponsored by official University constituencies. Events on
the University events calendar are pulled from the calendars of departments and
organizations across campus in order to promote and showcase the multitude of
happenings at Valpo on a given day. In order to submit an event for inclusion in
the master calendar, please contact the calendar coordinator in the department or
organization sponsoring the event.
