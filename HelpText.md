<h2>Using the Events Calendar</h2>
</div>
By default, visiting the calendar [home page](http://www.valpo.edu/calendar "Calendar Home Page") will bring up a list of events going on around campus that day.
To load the events on a given day, just click on the desired day in the date picker on the left. The results will appear on the rest of the page according to the kind of event that it is.
Feel free to browse through any day in the past or the future. If you get lost, you can always return to where you started by clicking on the "Today" button.
When you are done browsing events you may return to [valpo.edu](http://www.valpo.edu/ "Valparaiso University Homepage") by clicking the logo at the top.

### Types of Events
__Upcoming Events:__ These are events that are actively promoted by Valparaiso University and may be happening on the selected day or the near future.
You can tell these events apart from others by the golden triangle in their top-left corner.

__All Day Events:__ These events are considered to be occurring during the entirety of one or many days. All Day Events can also be featured and many events can make-up an All Day Event. 

### Loading an Event
After you select a day from the date picker, a list of events will be shown for that day. Each event tile will give you a quick look at the event details, but to read into it with more detail click on the tile. 

### Filtering Events
If you wish to narrow-down the events that you see throughout the calendar, navigate to the events list page and click on the "Categories" button. You may click on one or many categories at a time. Each category selected will show events that belong to any one of them, so selecting more categories will show you more events. The only exception to this rule is if you clear all of the categories by clicking the "Clear" button in the filters window. No categories selected will show all events.

### Sharing an Event
If you find an event that you want to share with your friends, you may at any time copy the url and share it on your social network of choice.
